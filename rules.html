     <h1>Rules</h1>
       
       <h2>Requirements to Play</h2>
<p>In terms of supplies, you will need: paper, writing utensils, a set of dice (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12, and 1d20), and imagination! Other useful supplies would be a whiteboard and a dry erase marker, but besides that everything is up to the Dungeon Master, or DM.</p>

       <h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>Every character must have: name, level, stats, skills, equipment, and a patron god.</p>

<h3>Concerning levels:</h3> <p>Every player character, or PC, starts at level one, and advances from there. Every time they get a level, they will roll hit die to increase their health and gain one stat point to distribute. Levels are distributed with the discretion of the Dungeon Master, the person in charge of the game.</p>

<h3>Concerning stats:</h3><p> There are six general stats in Blood Trail, and two derived stats. The six general stats are:</p>
	
       <p><em>Intelligence or INT</em>: how smart your character is, and how fast they learn</p>
       <p><em>Wisdom or WIS</em>: how much willpower your character has, or how well they make decisions</p>
			
        <p><em>Strength or STR</em>: how strong your character is</p>
        <p><em>Dexterity or DEX</em>: how nimble your character is, and generally how much body control
			they have</p>
        <p><em>Charisma or CHA</em>: how well your character speaks and persuades</p>
        <p><em>Constitution or CON</em>: how much health and stamina your character has.</p>

<p>The two derived stats are:</p>
	<p><em>Health Points or HP</em>: How many times your character can get hit. HP is calculated
				by: adding 10 + your CON modifier (at level 1) or by adding
				adding 10 + your level + your CON modifier (after level 1)</p>
	<p><em>Armor Class or AC</em>: The amount an enemy has to roll in order to hit you. AC is
				calculated using: 10 + your level + your DEX modifier
				(If you are wearing armor, certain armors nullify your DEX
				modifier in favor of giving more AC)
</p>


<h4>Determining Stats:</h4>
<p>In order to determine stats, a player must roll a d6 (six sided die) 3 times. These numbers must be added. This process should be repeated 7 more times, so the player has 8 values between 3 and 18. The highest 6 values should be taken and distributed among the stats of your choosing. </p>

<p>For example, if you got an 18, and you want to specialize in pickpocketing, you want to assign the 18 as your starting DEX value.</p>

<h4>Determining Modifiers:</h4>
<p>If your stats are high enough, or low enough, they merit a modifier, which will modify your actions and rolls. If the stat is not 10-11, the stat gets a modifier based on how high it is.<br><br></p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Base Stat Amount</th>
        <th>Modifier</th>
    </tr>       
    <tr>
    <td>0-1</td>
        <td>-5</td>
          </tr>

        <tr> <td>2-3</td>
        <td>-4</td></tr>
         <tr><td>4-5</td>
        <td>-3</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>6-7</td>
        <td>-2</td></tr>
         <tr><td>8-9</td>
        <td>-1</td></tr>
         <tr><td>10-11</td>
        <td>0</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>12-13</td>
        <td>1</td></tr>
         <tr><td>14-15</td>
        <td>2</td></tr>
         <tr><td>16-17</td>
        <td>3</td></tr>
         <tr><td>18-19</td>
        <td>4</td></tr>
</table>
       <p>And so on and so forth...</p>

        <h2>Modifiers: Damage and Checks</h2>
<p>Your modifiers, and by extension, your stats, come in handy when you want to see if your actions succeed, whether it be a combat roll or a check of some sort. Sometimes a damage roll will be calculated with a die and a modifier. Ranged weapons use DEX modifiers, and Melee weapons use STR modifiers. </p>


<p>A check is when you want to take an action, and you must roll. You can add a modifier to these checks, depending on the type of check it is. Every check usually has a stat or more attributed to it. For example, if you wanted to trick someone into thinking you are not their enemy, you would do a CHA check (1d20 + CHA modifier).</p>
       <h2>Leveling Up:</h2>
       <p>
       When your character levels up (as decided by the DM), your character is allowed one new base stat point. This new stat point can go to any of your 6 base stats (STR, DEX, etc...). Since your AC calculations are affected by level, you should also recalculate that.</p>
           <p>After those considerations, you should roll your class hit die and add your Constitution modifier. That is the amount that you will add to your health. </p>
           <p>The final consideration when levelling up is skill points. The amount of skill points you get when you level up, you can find on your class pages.
       </p>
       
       
       <h2>Actually Playing</h2>
       <p>
       So when you finish making a character, assembled a party of like minded adventurers, and found a competent DM, you can begin playing. The game is played using primarily your imagination. The DM is your guide through the story of the game. You'll encounter many scenarios and obstacles. Some will be combat oriented and some won't be.
</p>
       <p>There are two phases of ICHOR gameplay.</p>
       <h3>Narrative Phase</h3>
       <p>During this phase, things happen in real time. You are not in combat, and you are going about your business in the world of the game. You could be shopping, swimming, fishing or just sleeping. This is where the principle meat of the game exists. In this phase you will be interacting with individuals, and the way that you interact with them may be the difference between entering combat phase or not.</p>
       <h3>Combat Phase</h3>
       <p><em>"Roll Initiative."</em></p>
       <p>When you enter combat, you, your party, and the DM will roll initiative. Initiative decides who goes first, second, etc... in battle. The Combat phase, for simplicity's sake, operates in turn based combat.</p>
